🔐 Match the Code

Match the Code is a simple interactive PIN‑matching game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal is to enter the correct 4‑digit PIN using an on‑screen keypad. Each incorrect attempt triggers an annoying sound that only stops when the correct code is entered.

🎮 How It Works

The interface displays a 4‑digit PIN input.

Users enter numbers using the on‑screen keypad.

Every key press plays an annoying sound.

The sound only stops when the correct PIN is entered.

The number of attempts is tracked and displayed.

Users can clear the input or delete the last digit.

🛠️ Technologies Used

HTML5 – Structure and layout

CSS3 – Styling, layout, and visual effects

JavaScript (Vanilla) – Game logic and interactivity
